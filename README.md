## Introduction

>A web page (or webpage) is a document on the World Wide Web "with its own address". Web pages are delivered by a web server to the user and displayed in a web browser to act as a "retrieval unit" for the information stored within it. A website consists of many web pages linked together under a common domain name. The name "web page" is a metaphor of paper pages bound together into a book.

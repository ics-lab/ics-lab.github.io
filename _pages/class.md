### (F054) Information Security
<hr>
In this course, the main purpose of security is to consider the topic of information protection/information security as a flow for students in the cybersecurity department, and to develop a person-centered macro view and have a vision, not an approach as a technology. The goal is to provide students in the software department and other IT-related departments whose main purpose is not security, with an introduction to the major and an understanding of cybersecurity in general before taking courses in cybersecurity majors.

### (F022) Digital Forensics
<hr>
In this course, covers security systems based on software, security technology for web based operating system platforms and wireless communication softwares, and application services and contents security. Students will improve overall basic and application ability for software security by studying software security technology and issues in embedded Linux, mobile operating systems like Android, applications on NFC and Wifi, clients and mobile Web, and mobile devices.
This Lab covers software security systems experiment, security experiments for web based operating system platforms and wireless communication softwares, and application services and contents security experiments. Students will improve design and application ability for software security by experimenting on software security technology and issues in embedded Linux, mobile operating systems like Android, applications on NFC and Wifi, clients and mobile Web, and mobile devices.

### (F033) Cyber Security Capstone Design
<hr>
In this course, comprehensively utilizes the major knowledge and design skills gained in the undergraduate course and evaluates learning outcomes. It focuses on acquiring the ability to participate as a core development manpower in the industry after graduation while experiencing the development process such as problem definition, component design, implementation, and evaluation. In particular, students improve their collaboration skills through team-level projects and learn creative problem solving methods using TRIZ. Through this course, students will develop their skills that can be applied directly to the field and gain extensive experience to prepare for work in the field.

### (F030) Undergraduate Research I
<hr>
In this course, each student conducts graduate-level research while being supervised by a professor who provides a research topic and having a weekly meeting. It is required to survey prior art of the topic, analyze it, derive a new method, and verify the proposed one by experimental results. Final results should be presented in the final workshop as well as in the final report. It is recommended to submit a paper to any international/domestic conference.

<br>

### (F042) Security Career Search
<hr>
In this course, deals with information security career design and career path. It is intended to provide guidelines for preparing for the selection, comparison, and activities of the subject you need in earnest. To this end, special lectures on career guidance are conducted in cooperation with the University Job Center, and at the same time, special lectures are conducted by recruiting department professors and external experts in consideration of the characteristics of the department. Finally, it invites graduates to share their career exploration and design experiences in university.
